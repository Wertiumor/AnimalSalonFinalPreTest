                        In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and
                        leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only
                        woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable
                        as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a
                        variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to
                        tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend
                        to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller
                        palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370
                        million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion
                        mature trees in the world.[1]
